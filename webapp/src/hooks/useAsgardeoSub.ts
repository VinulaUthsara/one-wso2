// Resolves the current Asgardeo user's `sub` claim. Used as an identity
// discriminator in downstream query keys so a sign-out → different-user
// sign-in in the same tab can't briefly serve the previous user's cached
// data.
//
// We can't use useAsgardeo().user for this — that field is only populated
// when `preferences.user.fetchUserProfile` is true (we disable it) or on
// the AsgardeoV2 platform (our tenant isn't). Decoding the id_token via
// the SDK is the one path that always works.
//
// Returns a three-state value so a caller can distinguish loading
// (`{status: "loading"}`), success (`{status: "ready", sub}`), and
// terminal failure (`{status: "error", message}`). Callers surface the
// error state in the UI instead of leaving downstream queries silently
// disabled with an undefined key.
//
// Single-source-of-truth by design: every hook that needs the user's
// `sub` (useMeProfile, useUserInfo, and others) consumes this hook, so
// the resolved `sub` is byte-identical across every consumer within a
// render tree.

// Identity errors always take precedence over whatever error state the

// React Query's real refetch() bypasses `enabled` (see the note on

// from some earlier forced refetch attempt (a stray double-click, the
// devtools' manual refetch, ...) even while identity is unresolved. If we
// deferred to that instead, the page would show whatever unrelated error
// that fetch produced, with `.refetch` pointing at React Query's real
// refetch — which just re-fires the same doomed queryFn instead of ever
// retrying identity, permanently shadowing the one error that's actually
// recoverable. Once identity resolves (`enabled` flips true), the real
// query state takes over normally.
//
// The synthetic result doesn't match React Query's discriminated union
// exactly (the four *Result variants have exclusive boolean flags), so we
// cast through unknown — callers only read isError + error + isPending +
// isLoading + isFetching + isSuccess + refetch, and this shape sets those
