// The signed-in user's Asgardeo group memberships, read from the `groups`
// claim of the id_token. The `groups` scope is already requested at sign-in
// (see authConfig), so the claim is present without an extra round trip.
//
// Why this exists at all, when every other authorization decision in this app
// comes from a backend: some services gate on an Asgardeo group WITHOUT
// exposing a `/me` endpoint that says whether the caller holds it. The
// subscription service is the first — it publishes the NAMES of its two admin
// groups on /subscriptions/meta-info and leaves the comparison to the client,
// which is exactly what its own standalone app did. Marketing Ops, which does
// have `/api/me`, should keep asking the backend instead: a server-computed
// answer can't drift from what the server will actually allow.
//
// This is presentation only, in the strict sense. It decides which controls
// are worth showing; every one of them still hits a backend that re-derives
// the same groups from the JWT and 403s a caller who doesn't hold them. A
// tampered token doesn't grant anything — it grants a screen whose every
// button fails.
//
// Same decode path as useAsgardeoUser / useAsgardeoSub: useAsgardeo().user is
// only populated when `preferences.user.fetchUserProfile` is on (we disable
// it) or on AsgardeoV2 (our tenant isn't), so decoding the id_token is the one
// route that always works.
