// Reads a token's own `exp` so a 401 can be attributed rather than guessed at.
//
// Until this existed, every 401 was treated as possible evidence that our
// session had died: the 401 provoked a silent re-auth, and that attempt failing
// raised the session-expired dialog for the whole app. One backend answering
// 401 for its own reasons — a bad audience, a misconfigured gateway, a bug —
// could therefore take down every screen, including the ones it has nothing to
// do with.
//
// The token says who is at fault. If it has not expired, our credentials are
// fine and the 401 belongs to the backend that sent it.
//
// Asgardeo issues JWT access tokens in this tenant, so `exp` is readable
// client-side without a network call. Nothing here verifies the SIGNATURE and
// nothing may start: a client-side check decides whose fault a 401 is, never
// whether to trust a token. The backend does that.
