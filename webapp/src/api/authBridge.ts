// Bridges Asgardeo's session-renewal primitive into plain (non-React) code
// that only ever sees a token *string* per call and has no way to reach
// useAsgardeo() itself. A mount-only component (AuthBridgeMount, wired in
// AppWithConfig.tsx) registers the live getIdToken/getAccessToken/
// signInSilently once the SDK is ready.
//
// Two callers, two different tokens, one shared re-auth:
//   - @api/http's 401 → retry path calls refreshAccessToken() — every
//     backend call in this app authorizes with the access_token.
//   - @hooks/useAsgardeoSub's getDecodedIdToken() → retry path calls
//     refreshIdToken() — groups/email/sub are id_token-only claims,
//     unrelated to which token authorizes backend calls.
// Neither getIdToken() nor getAccessToken() checks expiry itself — both are
// plain storage reads — so once a token's lifetime passes, callers keep
// attaching the same dead value until something re-authenticates.
// signInSilently() is Asgardeo's cookie-based silent re-auth (the same
// mechanism people-app, leave-app, menu-app and visitor-app all lean on via
// their own AuthContext.tsx, just exposed under a different name in this
// SDK) — refreshing renews the whole session, so both token getters read
// fresh values off the same renewal.

//
// Deduping concurrent callers is not enough on its own. `inFlightRefresh`
// clears the moment an attempt settles, so *sequential* 401s each start a
// brand-new silent re-auth — and once every backend is 401ing off the same
// dead token, they arrive continuously. A HAR taken while silent re-auth was
// broken recorded 19 authorize attempts in 3m04s, all carrying the same
// `state` (the flow never advanced), 17 authorization codes minted at
// Asgardeo, and zero token exchanges. Every attempt got a code and abandoned
// it.
//
// So the bridge remembers failures: back off between attempts, and after three
// consecutive ones stop trying altogether and let the UI ask the user to sign
// in. Silent renewal is the only thing that can fail here — a full-page sign-in
// still works, which is why a manual browser refresh always cleared this.
