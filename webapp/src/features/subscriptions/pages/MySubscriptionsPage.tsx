// Opt yourself in and out of the two paid staff services.
//
// Ported from the digiops-hr subscription-app, which until now existed only as
// a mobile microapp — this is its first web view. The functional spec, the API
// contract and the deliberate differences from the original are in
// docs/ported-apps/subscription-app.md; read that rather than reconstructing
// the rules from this file.
//
// Two things worth knowing here specifically:
//
//  - `now` comes from useMidnightClock and flows down as a prop. Nothing
//    below this page reads the clock, which is what makes the opt-in/opt-out
//    window rules testable (see util/subscriptionWindows). A tab left open
//    across midnight with no other reason to re-render would otherwise keep
//    showing a window that just opened as closed — or one that just closed
//    as still open — until something else happened to force a re-render;
//    the clock schedules its own update at the boundary instead of waiting
//    for one.
//  - The subject of every call is the signed-in user's own email, taken from
//    the id_token. The backend compares it with the token's own address and
//    applies the self-service rules; the same components with a different
//    email are what the admin screen renders.
