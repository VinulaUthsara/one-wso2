// Marketing Ops perspective landing page: a bento of the operations, and nothing
// else.
//
// It used to be a page of prose — 285 words across 17 item cards, each carrying a
// full sentence, under an operation-level "purpose" line that mostly repeated them.
// That reads as documentation, and a landing page's first job is to get you out of
// it. So the descriptions are gone and the tile is the unit: an operation, its
// screens as links, no explanation. The labels already say what the screens are.
//
// ---- why a bento and not the old grid ------------------------------------
//
// The grid before this was `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(214px, 1fr))`: on a wide
// screen it made five or six skinny columns of identical weight and unequal
// height. Nothing on the page was bigger than anything else, so there was no
// entry point and no reading order — the eye had nowhere to land first.
//
// Now the first operation takes a double-width feature tile and carries the
// page's ONLY brand wash; everything else sits around it at one of two widths.
// The sizing rule, and why a fixed-column bento needs a pack step at all, are in
// ./bentoLayout.
//
// The feature was briefly 2x2 — two rows tall as well as two columns wide. It
// left ~75px of empty card under its last link, because a header plus four links
// is not as tall as the two rows beside it. Both attempts to fill that space were
// rejected, and both rightly:
//
//   - live status per tile (queue depths, draft counts, last-run times): a
//     launcher that also reports status says two things at once, and the badges
//     turned a grid you scan into a page you have to read;
//   - the operation's `purpose` sentence: description text on the one tile with
//     room for it is documentation on a launcher, and it singles out one
//     operation for an explanation none of the others get.
//
// The hole was a geometry problem, and inventing content to plug it was the wrong
// way round. So no tile is two rows tall now: the feature is prominent by width,
// wash and glyph size, and every tile is exactly as tall as its row needs. If
// this page ever does report state it should be one deliberate strip, not a badge
// per tile.
//
// ---- what else went, and why ---------------------------------------------
//
//   - The "Your access" card. It showed the caller's own email address and their
//     Asgardeo group COUNT, which is diagnostic rather than useful — it existed to
//     prove the gateway hop worked when this was the perspective's only page. The
//     access states now come from MarketingOpsShell, which already distinguishes
//     all four (unconfigured / resolving / request failed / not authorized) and
//     says the same thing about Asgardeo groups in the denial case.
//
//   - `requireAuthorized={false}`. Its whole purpose was to let an unauthorized
//     visitor land here and be pointed at Marketing Ops proper instead of hitting a
//     wall. There is nothing left to point at — every operation is ported — so the
//     shell's warning is now the honest answer, and it is better written than the
//     block this page kept alongside it.
//
//   - ItemCard's "Not here yet" / "In Marketing Ops ↗" states, which could no
//     longer render for the same reason.
//
//   - The "✦ Marketing Ops perspective" eyebrow chip. Every operation screen now
//     shows an eyebrow carrying its OWN icon and name, which tells you which of the
//     six you are in. On this page the chip only restated the title under it, and
//     PerspectiveHeader dropped the identical sparkle chip from the other
//     perspective pages for that reason — the rail already says where you are.
//
//   - The Marketing Admin strip: a full-width card whose panel pills were pushed
//     to the right edge with `ml: auto`, leaving a long empty middle and making the
//     quietest thing on the page also the widest.
//
//     It was briefly a hairline "Configure" band under the grid instead, and that
//     over-corrected — demoted to a footer, it read as fine print for the thing
//     that holds the import contracts and the Pardot send defaults. Marketing
//     Admin is now a TILE like the others, two columns wide, sitting after the
//     operations and before ISAC. It gets the same weight as what it configures,
//     and its Settings icon is what marks it as the one that configures rather
//     than one of the things configured.
//
//   - The "4 screens" / "4 panels" count under each tile name. See the note on
//     the header row in OperationTile: it counted what the CALLER may open, so
//     the same operation read "4 screens" to an admin and "1 screen" to a
//     submitter — a number nobody can act on, attached to a list you can see.
//
// ---- what the access gate does to this page ------------------------------
//
// Every tile here is conditional. `canSee` runs per ITEM, so RBAC changes both
// which tiles exist and how many links each one holds, and the page has to look
// deliberate for all of it rather than only for the admin who sees everything.
// What that relies on:
//
//   - Nothing renders at all for an unauthorized caller: MarketingOpsShell holds
//     the page on `requireAuthorized` and explains the Asgardeo group instead. So
//     the minimum this grid ever draws is what an AUTHORIZED caller with no
//     capabilities sees, which is Utilities — the one app with no `requires`.
//     There is no empty-grid state to design, and `operations` is never empty.
//   - `isAdmin` is a master key in hasMarketingOpsCapability, so "sees Marketing
//     Admin" implies "sees every operation". The Admin tile can therefore never
//     turn up as the only tile, or as the first one, which is what lets the
//     feature slot be "the first operation" without a special case for it.
//   - Widths come from the FILTERED item counts, so a tile that RBAC reduced to
//     one link is sized as a one-link tile rather than keeping a four-link
//     footprint with three links missing from it.
//   - The feature is whichever operation comes first for THIS caller, and it is
//     suppressed below three tiles — a lone Utilities tile with the brand wash
//     on it would be announcing an entry point to a page with one door.
//
// packBento handles the varying tile count by walking placement the way the
// browser does, so no hole opens between tiles; its tests walk the capability
// sets that actually occur rather than arbitrary subsets.
export default function MarketingOpsPage() {
  const gate = useMarketingOpsGate();

  // An operation whose every screen is hidden by the gate is dropped entirely —
  // an empty tile is worse than no tile, because it advertises something and then
