// The Active Employees report, ported from people-app's
// view/reports/ActiveEmployeesReportView. Everything specific to "active" is
// here; EmployeeReportTable holds what this shares with the Resignations
// report that follows it.
//
// Two defaults distinguish this report, and both are ON:
//  - excludeFutureStartDate — accepted offers who haven't joined yet are not
//    part of the active headcount.
//  - includeMarkedLeavers — people serving notice still are. "Marked leaver"
//    is a separate status from "Left", and excluding them would undercount.
